# Project Silicon
A game project by AleeCorp

# PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT
We are officially ending support for the WinForms version and replacing it with Unreal Engine once Alpha 0.2 is released...

You might ask why? Well.. we want to make a better version of this project and yeah, WinForms is designed to be software based and not game based.

**UPDATE: We are going to port it to MonoHack which is made by AShifter**
